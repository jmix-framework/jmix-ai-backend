            <p>Web development encompasses a variety of technologies and practices that enable the creation of websites and
                web applications. From simple static pages to complex dynamic applications, web development skills are essential
                in today's digital world.</p>
            <p>This document outlines the core concepts and technologies that form the foundation of modern web development.</p>

        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>Frontend development focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with
                in their browsers. It combines several technologies to deliver engaging user experiences.</p>
            <p>Modern frontend development has evolved significantly over the past decade, with frameworks and libraries
                making complex interactions more manageable.</p>

                <div class="sectionbody">
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structural foundation for all web pages. It uses elements
                        and tags to define the content hierarchy and organization.</p>
                    <p>Semantic HTML, introduced with HTML5, emphasizes meaningful structure that improves accessibility and
                        search engine optimization.</p>

                <h3 id="css"><a class="anchor" href="#css"></a>CSS Styling</h3>
                <div class="sectionbody">
                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual presentation of HTML elements. It allows developers to define colors, layouts, fonts, and animations.</p>
                    <p>Modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid have revolutionized web layouts, making responsive design more intuitive and powerful.</p>

        <h2 id="backend"><a class="anchor" href="#backend"></a>Backend Development</h2>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>Backend development involves server-side programming that powers the functionality behind web applications. It handles data processing, business logic, and database interactions.</p>
            <p>A robust backend ensures security, performance, and reliability of web applications across various user scenarios.</p>

            <div class="sect2">
                <h3 id="server"><a class="anchor" href="#server-tech"></a>Server Technologies</h3>
                <p>Server technologies include programming languages and frameworks that process requests and generate responses. Popular options include Node.js, Python, Java, and PHP.</p>
                <p>Modern server architectures often implement RESTful or GraphQL APIs to facilitate communication between frontend and backend systems.</p>
                <p>Server scalability is crucial for handling increased load and traffic. Horizontal scaling through load
                    balancers and containerization allows applications to maintain performance under heavy usage.</p>
                <p>Deployment strategies like continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) enable smooth updates
                    and rollbacks. Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes help manage complex deployments.</p>
                <p>Security considerations in server technologies include authentication, authorization, data encryption,
                    and protection against common vulnerabilities. Regular security audits and updates are essential.</p>

            <div class="sect2">
                <h3 id="databases"><a class="anchor" href="#db"></a>Database Systems</h3>
                <p>Databases store and organize application data for efficient retrieval and manipulation. They come in various forms including relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.</p>
                <p>Choosing the right database system depends on factors such as data structure, scalability requirements, and query patterns.</p>

        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>Modern web development relies on various tools to streamline workflows and improve code quality. Version control systems, package managers, and build tools form an essential part of the development ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Mastering these tools can significantly enhance productivity and collaboration in development teams.</p>
